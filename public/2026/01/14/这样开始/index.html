      <p><strong>It goes like this.</strong> This is my first blog post on this site, as an effort to built my own place so I do not dependent on other sites. However, this is not as straightforward as I thought it would be. Acctually, it took longer than I thought. Fortunately, I did it at the end.</p>
<p>I am planning to pursue my dream as a writer anyway and would like a secret place to put my writing down as a draft. I somehow does not want to be confined in one place and let my writing to be owned by other website. And I also would like to have a copy of everything I write.</p>
<p>So this is the place I would like to keep.</p>
<p>Good luck to me. God bless me.</p>
